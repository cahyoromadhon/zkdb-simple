A simple and beginner-friendly Node.js application to explore the power of **zkDatabase** by Orochi Network. This project demonstrates how to connect to zkDatabase, perform user authentication (sign-up and sign-in), and store a basic note using the zkDB SDK, all secured with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) on the Mina Protocol testnet. Perfect for developers new to Web3 and privacy-focused blockchain applications! ðŸš€

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and sign in using zkDatabase's secure authentication system.
- **Document Storage**: Create and store simple notes in a NoSQL-like database with ZKP.
- **Lightweight Setup**: Minimal dependencies and easy-to-run code for quick experimentation.
- **Testnet Ready**: Built for Orochi Network's zkDatabase testnet, no real funds required.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher.
- **Dependencies**: `zkdb` and `mina-signer` Node.js packages.
- **Internet Connection**: Required to connect to the zkDatabase testnet (`https://api.zkdatabase.org/graphql`).
- **System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows with at least 8GB RAM.
